# 🏠 LazyRoom

**LazyRoom** is a Flutter-based mobile marketplace built for students living in university dormitories. It connects **customers** (students), **suppliers** (in-dorm sellers), and an **admin** in a single app, letting students order everyday products without leaving their room, suppliers manage their own storefront, and admins oversee the whole ecosystem — including a built-in wallet/balance system for payments.

---

## 📖 Overview

Living in a university dorm often means limited access to nearby shops. **LazyRoom** solves this by turning the dorm itself into a marketplace: students browse products listed by in-dorm suppliers, add them to a cart, and place orders — all paid for through an in-app balance rather than cash. Suppliers accept or reject incoming orders, and the admin manages accounts, resolves balances, and keeps the platform running smoothly.

The app is built with a clean, role-based architecture, so each type of user gets a dedicated home screen and workflow tailored to their needs.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Multi-Role Authentication
- Single login screen with automatic routing to the correct home screen based on the user's role: **Customer**, **Supplier**, or **Admin**.
- Token-based authentication with session persistence, so users stay logged in between app launches.
- Dedicated registration flow for new customers, capturing dorm-specific details such as **building** and **room number** for accurate order delivery.

### 🛍️ Customer Experience
- Browse all available products, filterable by category.
- Add items to a cart and review them before checkout.
- Confirm and place orders directly from an in-app wallet balance.
- Track order history and order status (pending, accepted, completed, cancelled).
- View and manage a personal profile.

### 📦 Supplier Tools
- A dedicated supplier dashboard to manage a personal product catalog: add, edit, and delete products (name, description, price, category, and stock).
- Manage incoming orders: **accept** or **reject** customer orders in real time.
- View a personal profile and account balance.

### 🛠️ Admin Control Panel
- Full visibility over all **customer** and **supplier** accounts.
- Create and delete user accounts.
- Ban and unban users to moderate the platform.
- **Deposit** funds into a customer's wallet or **withdraw** funds from a supplier's balance, keeping the in-app economy balanced.

### 💰 Wallet / Balance System
- Every account carries a live balance used to pay for and receive orders, instead of handling cash on delivery.
- Balance can be refreshed on demand and is updated automatically as orders are placed, accepted, or settled by the admin.

### 🎨 Polished UI/UX
- Custom light and dark themes that automatically follow the system setting.
- Reusable, purpose-built widgets (product cards, dialogs, list views) for a consistent look across all three roles.
